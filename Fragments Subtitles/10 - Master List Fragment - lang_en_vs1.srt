1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:02,100
Since the master
list fragment will not

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,500
change during the
activity's run time,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,509
it is considered
a static fragment.

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,419
And I can place it in a layout
using the fragment tag instead

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:11,009
of a transaction.

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,679
The fragment should have a name
and a width and height, just

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,108
like a typical view.

8
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:16,800
And the name is
actually going to point

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,990
to the type of fragment this is.

10
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,228
And I've given it the
ID, master list fragment.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,449
Finally I'll create a
new main activity that

12
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,504
displays this activity layout.

13
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:29,250
In here, I'll override
the uncreate method

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,928
and set the content view.

15
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,640
The last step in
this exercise will

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,579
be to declare this activity
in the Android manifest file

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,978
and set it to default launch.

18
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:40,238
Let's see what it looks like.

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,149
Here's what the
app looks like now.

20
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,628
In the next exercise, you'll
be given minor guidance

21
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,400
on completing and displaying
this list of images.

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,094
By the end of the
exercise, you should

23
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:50,759
have a list of all
our images that looks

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,582
like this on a phone screen.

25
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:54,539
After this section, we'll
work on communicating

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,920
between fragments and
their host activities.
