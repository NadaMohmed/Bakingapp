1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,500
Now we can think of
fragments as mini activities,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,740
as portions of UI each
with their own lifecycle,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,769
but they also have to be
embedded within an activity.

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,570
So how does the
fragment lifecycle

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,759
compare with the
activity lifecycle,

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,559
and how do they work together?

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,089
Since a fragment must be
embedded in an activity,

8
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:22,169
its lifecycle is directly
affected by the host activity

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,550
lifecycle.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,160
So as the host activity
moves through its callbacks,

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,640
on start, on resume,
on pause, and on stop,

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,890
so do any fragments it contains.

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,530
And in most cases, you
can move any functionality

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,530
you would have put in those
activity lifecycle callbacks

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,560
to the corresponding
callback inside a fragment.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,600
There are a few
differences though.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,660
For example, fragments have
additional lifecycle callbacks

18
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:47,819
that allow them to
be created or removed

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,380
in an activity at runtime.

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,200
So rather than
building a new view

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,990
in on create, as
activities do, fragments

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,140
use a different event for
this called on create view.

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,469
On create view is where a
fragment inflates its UI,

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,448
hooks up any data
sources it needs,

25
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,600
and then returns the created
view to the host activity.

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,429
And there's a corresponding
on destroy view

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,190
callback that can be called
before a host activity is

28
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:12,419
destroyed.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,280
With these additional
callbacks, a fragment

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,858
can actually cycle through
its whole lifecycle

31
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,949
multiple times as its
host activity is running.

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,198
Next, you'll get a little
more info about the fragment

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,370
lifecycle and test your
knowledge in a quiz.
