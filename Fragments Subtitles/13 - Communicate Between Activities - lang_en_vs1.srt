1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,649
Now that we know how
to successfully communicate

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:05,620
between our master list
fragment and the main activity.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,220
And there's one more step.

4
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:10,150
We need to transfer information
from our main activity

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,790
to our body part fragments
to effectively update

6
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:14,558
their contents.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,830
So when an image is selected
in the master list fragment,

8
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,329
we'll want to store
the list index

9
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,239
to display for each of the
head, body, and leg images

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,500
that were selected.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,870
Then display those choices
in the following Android Me

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,519
activity.

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,308
First, I'll add class
variables to store the location

14
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,809
of the clicked images.

15
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,320
One variable each for the
head, body, and leg images.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,359
These values will
all be in the range 0

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,880
through 11, because there's 12
images for each of these lists.

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,330
But the click position
goes all the way up to 35,

19
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:46,989
as we said before, since
the list of all images.

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,810
So to get the correct body
part in the correct index,

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,880
we have to do some helpful math.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,429
We know that there are 12 images
for heads, bodies, and legs.

23
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,908
So if we divide the
click position by 12,

24
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,689
we can identify
the type of image,

25
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,259
whether it's a head,
body, or leg, and the list

26
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,959
index they are in their
respective fragment image idea

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,740
lists.

28
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:09,280
Here the body part number will
be 0 for the head fragment,

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,760
1 for the body, and 2
for the leg fragment.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,719
And the list index will always
be a value between 0 and 11.

31
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,518
Then using a switch
statement, we

32
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,399
can update the index variables
in the on image selected

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
callback.

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,930
And we'll set the correct
index no matter what the case.

35
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,400
Then to actually pass this
information to an Android Me

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,180
activity, we'll need to
bundle it up and attach it

37
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,840
to a new intent that launches
a new Android Me activity.

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,920
And again a bundle is just
a set of key value pairs.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,540
To actually launch
this activity,

40
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,940
I'm also going to add a
button labeled Next that

41
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:46,869
moves us from our master list
to the Android Me activity.

42
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,590
So in our master list
fragment we at the bottom

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,780
I'll add a Next button,
and I'll wrap both of these

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,480
in a vertical linear layout.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,730
I'll give the button the ID
Next button, so that I can

46
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,079
refer to it in our activity.

47
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,988
So back in the
main activity code,

48
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,448
I'll give a reference to that
Next button, and on a click

49
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,120
it will launch a new
Android Me activity.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,520
There's one more task
that I'll leave up to you.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,260
In the Android Me
activity, you'll

52
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,448
have to retrieve the bundle
of information that's

53
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,000
been sent in this intent,
and set the correct list

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,669
index for all the
body part fragments.

55
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,379
Once you complete
this exercise, you'll

56
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:21,728
have a complete phone app.

57
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,289
And we just have
one more exercise

58
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,538
to complete our two
pane tablet layout.

59
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,718
Great job so far.
