00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:01,569
(cezanne camacho) Hey there.

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,429
Welcome to Advanced Android.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,740
My name is Cezanne
Camacho, and in this lesson

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,810
we'll be learning
about fragments.

5
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:09,609
Fragments are Android
app components

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,070
that represent a
self-contained portion of user

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,198
interface in an activity.

8
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:16,719
You can think of them
as mini-activities.

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,669
We'll learn all about
fragments in this lesson

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,940
by working together to
build an app that uses them.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,280
We'll be building an app
called Android Me that

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,450
lets us create and customize
the appearance of an Android

13
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,739
by giving it different
hairstyles, clothing,

14
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,298
and accessories.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,850
I've already provided some
starting code for this app,

16
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,660
and I'll walk through that soon.

17
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,088
For now, know that
we'll be using

18
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,970
sets of images that let
us choose the head, body,

19
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:42,975
and leg portions of the
Android individually.

20
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,558
We'll also be following
the principles

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,530
of responsive design, which
means that we'll build our app

22
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,225
to look great across a variety
of different screen sizes.

23
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,600
Next, we'll see
how fragments can

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,980
help us build responsive
and flexible layouts.
