1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,229
OK.

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,326
Now that you know a bit
more about fragments

3
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:04,910
and why they're so
useful for building

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,000
a responsive and flexible
UI, let's dive into the code

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,769
you'll be starting with.

6
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:12,469
And let's take a look at what
the final app will look like.

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,720
Throughout this lesson we'll
be building an Android Me

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,230
app that lets us create
a custom android.

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,210
The end result will
look like this.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,010
It lets you select
different images

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,140
for the head,
body, and leg parts

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,330
of the android from a list.

13
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,888
And when you click
on an image, it

14
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,410
updates how the final android
looks in this layout that

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,719
displays the whole android.

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,009
So you can select body, legs,
and heads as you choose.

17
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,988
This is the final two
pane tablet layout,

18
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,480
but we'll be starting by coding
up the layouts on a smaller

19
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:43,558
screen phone first.

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,560
It will be up to you to
write most of this code,

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,120
but I've provided
some starter code

22
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,649
so that you'll be able to focus
on creating and displaying

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,259
fragments.

24
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,929
The code you'll be starting
with includes some image assets

25
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,109
and a utility class that
helps you load the images.

26
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,789
All the images we're using are
in the drawable folder here.

27
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,519
And there are 12 images
each for bodies like this.

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,109
Also 12 images for heads, and
12 for different types of legs.

29
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:12,318
We also have a utility class
called android image assets.

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,859
And in here, you're given
ArrayLists of those image IDs--

31
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,289
which are integers-- and
their corresponding getter

32
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,180
methods at the bottom.

33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,000
getHeads returns
all head image IDs.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,299
getBodies returns all the
ideas for images of bodies.

35
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,429
getLegs returns
the leg image IDs.

36
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,840
And finally, getAll will return
a list of all the image IDs.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,326
Nothing in this utility
class should be changed.

38
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,948
We'll be using these
methods later when

39
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,430
we build fragments and tell
them what images to display.

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,590
You'll also start with
a basic activity called

41
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,049
Android Me activity, and a
corresponding, fairly simple

42
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,090
layout.

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,210
You'll also see a class
called master list adapter.

44
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,239
This adapter is responsible
for taking in a list of images

45
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,099
and displaying them
as a grid view list,

46
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,409
as we saw on the tablet before.

47
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,149
All this code is
well commented, and I

48
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,733
encourage you to
look around before we

49
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,737
dive into creating fragments.

50
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,819
The instructions for
downloading this starter code

51
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,728
can be found in text
following this video.

52
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,280
Our first task will be to
create a single fragment that

53
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,990
displays the head of our
custom android image.

54
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,770
Let's get started.
