1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,620
Our next task will
be to communicate

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,500
between our MasterList
and BodyPartFragments.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,548
And this can get
a little tricky.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,300
We already know that the real
advantage to using fragments

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,050
is their modularity
and reusability.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,730
So to build them for
maximum reusability,

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,370
we should make each
fragment self-contained.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,710
This just means that a
single fragment will also

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,859
contain code that defines
its layout and behavior, when

10
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,929
it comes to user interaction.

11
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,479
And it also means that,
generally, fragments

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,449
can never directly
communicate with one another.

13
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,700
But then, how can you
communicate between two

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,679
self-contained fragments?

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,228
Well, all fragment to
fragment communication

16
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:40,539
can be done through
a shared activity.

17
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:43,268
To give a fragment the ability
to communicate up to its host

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,580
activity, it's good
practice to define

19
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,798
an interface in
the fragment class,

20
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,079
and implement it
within the activity.

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,878
This is easier to
understand in code.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,200
So let's jump in and
define an interface.
