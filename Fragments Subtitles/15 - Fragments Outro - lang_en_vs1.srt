00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,589
Great job.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,988
You've now completed your
Android Me app.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,490
In the process,
you learned a lot

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,860
about the fragment
lifecycle and common uses

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,769
for fragments in
existing real world apps,

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,689
and you got a lot of
practice dynamically

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,580
creating and changing
fragments to build

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,309
a responsive and dynamic UI.

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,349
The app we built was
a little bit tricky,

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,390
so I'm confident that
you'll be able to use

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,510
what you learned in this
lesson in other apps too.

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,730
So again, great job
completing this app

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,539
and truly harnessing the power
of reusability and modularity.

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,200
Now let's go show off this app.
