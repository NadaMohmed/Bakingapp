00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,049
After seeing the Android Me
app, you might be thinking,

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,469
aren't these android images just
image views and view groups?

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:09,179
Why do we need to
use fragments instead

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,788
of using what we already know
about building responsive

5
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:12,929
layouts?

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,910
Well, the real power
in using fragments

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,420
is that they allow us to fully
modularize our activities.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,510
You can combine multiple
fragments in a single activity

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,420
to build a multi-pane
UI, like on a tablet.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,160
And you can reuse
a single fragment

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,990
in multiple activities.

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,509
So, separate from simple
layouts and views, a fragment

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,770
also has its own life cycle.

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,679
It can receive its
own user input events

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,270
like clicks or swipes.

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,760
You can also dynamically
add or remove them

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,798
while an activity is running.

18
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:42,570
An example where
this is very useful

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,340
is in the master
detail flow we talked

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,290
about earlier where,
on a phone, we

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,088
have two separate activities.

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,070
One that holds a master
list of items, then

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,740
another that displays
more detailed content.

24
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,410
And a good tablet layout will
have both of these activities

25
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:56,698
side by side.

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,640
However, activities are meant
to be on separate screens

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,109
and not embedded
within one another.

28
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,319
So, instead, Android
has fragments

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,170
which are designed to be
placed alone or in groups

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,450
within a single host activity.

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,100
Also, a fragment
doesn't have to be

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,168
paired with the same activity
or even the same location

33
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,430
in an activity each
time it's instantiated.

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,980
All of these traits,
including modularity,

35
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,050
make fragments extremely useful
for building a flexible UI.
