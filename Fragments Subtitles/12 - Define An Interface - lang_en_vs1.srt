1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,700
To communicate
between a fragment and its host

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,179
activity, you can define an
interface in the fragment class

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,458
and implement
within the activity.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,380
So let's do this to
have our master list

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,230
fragment communicate
with the main activity.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,630
To define an interface
we'll create a listener

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,030
in our master list fragment.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,350
You can name it anything.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,630
I'm calling it
onimageclicklistener,

10
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,539
and giving it the
variable m callback.

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,579
This will eventually be
implemented in the host

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,439
activity, and there
we can program

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,150
it to perform some
action whenever

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,899
a list image is clicked.

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,948
Then, to define this interface
we just specify the method

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,500
that it triggers.

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,158
Here we're having
it trigger method

18
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:40,228
called on image selected.

19
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,265
This takes an int
variable position,

20
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,850
which will just be the position
that a user clicks on our grid

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,300
view.

22
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:49,018
We also have to make sure that
the host activity implements

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,070
the callback.

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,600
And we can check
in the master list

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,969
fragments on attach method.

26
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,859
This is where a
fragment attaches itself

27
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,539
to its host activity.

28
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,518
Then it checks to see
that the image click

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,400
listener is implemented,
and if it's not it

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,140
throws an exception.

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,200
Lastly, in oncreate view, we
need to trigger the callback

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,769
on a click.

33
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,250
So we'll set a click
listener on the grid view,

34
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,099
and call the callback
method onimageselected

35
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,959
whenever an item in our
grid view is clicked.

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,558
Then we can pass in the
clicked position too.

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,870
Now that we've defined this
interface in our fragment,

38
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,920
let's link it to
our main activity.

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
I mentioned that in order
to receive callbacks

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,590
from the master list
fragment, the main activity

41
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,520
must implement the interface we
defined in the fragment class.

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,868
So right at the top we
write implementmasterl

43
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,075
istfragment.onim
ageclicklistener.

44
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:39,450
Then you can see
we get an error,

45
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,460
because this means we
also need to implement

46
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,399
the method on image selected.

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,550
So let's define the behavior
for on image selected.

48
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,219
And this is where we'll
handle fragment communication.

49
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:53,428
This interface acts a lot
like a custom click listener.

50
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,050
It's triggered in
the fragment class,

51
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,810
and performs some action
in the host activity.

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,030
For now in on image
selected, I've

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,099
created a Toast to see
if we've implemented

54
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,959
this communication correctly.

55
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,209
It should display a message
about the position clicked

56
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,808
when an image is selected.

57
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,090
Let's try it out.

58
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,008
Now you should see
a short Toast appear

59
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,250
every time I click on an
image in the master list.

60
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,449
The positions range from
0 all the way down to 35.

61
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,639
Next, it will be your turn
to complete this code,

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,199
and successfully
implement fragment

63
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,919
to activity communication.
