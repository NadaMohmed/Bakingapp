1
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:02,660
(VOICEOVER) I
mentioned before that fragments

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,349
are essentially reusable pieces
of UI, similar to a layout

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:07,359
or view group.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,960
And they can be
arranged differently

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,650
based on screen size.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,429
They're commonly used to create
single-pane and multi-pane

7
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:17,239
layouts, depending on what works
best for a given screen size.

8
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,989
For example, here's the Gmail
app, which has a list of emails

9
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,809
and their individual content
appear on different screens

10
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:24,910
on a phone.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,160
But on a tablet, the list
of emails and the content

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,079
appear side by side
because there's

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,000
enough room to see them both.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,460
So the Gmail app
layout changes based

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,689
on the screen size
of an Android device,

16
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,598
whether that's small
like on a phone

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,460
or larger like on a tablet.

18
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,920
And it uses fragments
to define each layout

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,560
and use the screen space
efficiently so that everything

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,660
is clear and readable.

21
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:49,518
The same goes for
many weather apps,

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,550
which often have a list of days
and separate detailed views

23
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:56,000
that appear differently on
phone screens and tablets.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,210
Same with the Contacts app
and so many more examples.

25
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,160
A phone screen will
have separate activities

26
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:04,408
for lists of information
and detailed content views,

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,209
whereas a tablet will have these
same views appear side by side.

28
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:11,549
In fact, this is such a common
pattern that it has a name.

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,179
It's called the
master, detail flow,

30
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,510
where the master list of items--
like contact names or emails--

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,969
will take up an entire
phone screen but only

32
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:22,428
the left portion
of a tablet screen.

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,980
And the detailed content
pane-- which often shows more

34
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,910
information about a selected
item in the master list--

35
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,959
will take up the entire phone
screen as a separate activity

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,305
but only the right portion
of a larger tablet screen.

37
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,890
This is the pattern we're going
to implement for our AndroidMe

38
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,439
app, with fragments that display
a master list of all the custom

39
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,619
Android images, as
well as fragments

40
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,859
that display parts of a detailed
full-body image of the Android.

41
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,428
Then, we'll arrange them in
single-pane and multi-pane

42
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,620
layouts, depending on the
size of the device screen.

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,310
So how do we build
something like this?

44
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,960
To implement this
on tablet, we'll

45
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,539
have one main activity that
contains our master list

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,470
fragment, the master list of all
images we'll be selecting from.

47
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,268
Then on the right
side of the screen,

48
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,728
we'll have three total
body part fragments,

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,030
which make up the head, body,
and leg portions of the custom

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,770
Android we want to make.

51
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,590
And on a phone, we'll have the
master list fragment and body

52
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,289
part fragments held in
two separate activities

53
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:21,168
so that each takes up the
full area of the phone screen.

54
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:24,019
And we'll see each
clearly and in sequence.

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,730
To complete this app,
you'll be provided

56
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,919
with some starting code
and then given tasks

57
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,109
to help you build this final UI.

58
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,050
Next, we'll talk more about why
you'd use fragments as opposed

59
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,340
to simple view groups.

60
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,840
And then we'll dive into code.
